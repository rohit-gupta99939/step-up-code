**3. System Analysis**

**3.1: IDENTIFICATION OF NEED**

System analysis is a process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems and the

information to recommend improvements on the system. It is a problem solving activity that

requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers. System

analysis or study is an important phase of any system development process. The system is

studies to the minutest detail and analysed. The system analyst plays the role of the

interrogator and dwells deep into the working of the present system. The System is viewed as

a whole and the input to the system are identified. The outputs from the organization are

traced to the various processes. System analysis is concerned with becoming aware of the

problem, identifying the relevant and Decisional variables, analysis and synthesizing the

various factors and determining an optimal or at least a satisfactory solution or program of

action. A detailed study of the process must be made by various techniques like interviews,

questionnaires etc. The data collected by these sources must be 9scrutinized to arrive to a

conclusion. The conclusion is an understanding of how the system functions. This system is

called the existing system. Now the existing system is subjected to close study and problem

area are identified. The designer now function as a problem solver and tries to sort out the

difficulties that the enterprise faces. The solutions are given as proposals. The proposal is

then weighed with the existing system analytically and the best one is selected. The proposal

is presented to the user for an endorsement by the user .The proposal is reviewed on user

request and suitable changes are made. This is loop that ends as soon as the user is satisfied

with proposal.

**3.2: FEASIBILITY STUDY**

The objective behind the feasibility study is to create the reasons for developing the software

that is acceptable to users, flexible to change and conformable to established standards.

**Types of Feasibility:**

**Technical Feasibility -** Technical feasibility evaluates the current technologies, which are

needed to accomplish customer requirements within the time and budget.

6 | P a g e





**Operational Feasibility -** Operational feasibility assesses the range in which the required

software performs a series of levels to solve business problems and customer requirements.

**Economic Feasibility -** Economic feasibility decides whether the necessary software can

generate financial profits for an organization.

Feasibility study is made to see if the project on completion will serve the purpose the

organization for the amount of work.

Effort and the time that spend on it.

The document provide the feasibility of the project that is being designed and lists various

area that were considered very carefully during the feasibility study of this project such as

Technical, Economical and operational feasibilities.

**4.System Design**

**4.1: Dataflow Diagram:-**

**DFD** is the abbreviation for **Data Flow Diagram**. The flow of data of a system or a process

is represented by DFD. It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and

the process itself. DFD does not have control flow and no loops or decision rules are

present. Specific operations depending on the type of data can be explained by a flowchart.

Data Flow Diagram can be represented in several ways. The DFD belongs to structured-

analysis modeling tools. Data Flow diagrams are very popular because they help us to

visualize the major steps and data involved in software-system processes.

Symbols of DFD:-

**Process**

Input to output transformation in a system takes place because of process function. The

symbols of a process are rectangular with rounded corners, oval, rectangle or a circle.

The process is named a short sentence, in one word or a phrase to express its essence

**Data Flow**

Data flow describes the information transferring between different parts of the systems.

The arrow symbol is the symbol of data flow. A relatable name should be given to the

flow to determine the information which is being moved.

**Warehouse**

The data is stored in the warehouse for later use. Two horizontal lines represent the

symbol of the store. The warehouse is simply not restricted to being a data file rather it

can be anything like a folder with documents, an optical disc, a filing cabinet.

12 | P a g e





**Terminator**

The Terminator is an external entity that stands outside of the system and communicates

with the system. It can be, for example, organizations like banks, groups of people like

customers or different departments of the same organization, which is not a part of the

model system and is an external entity. Modeled systems also communicate with

terminator.

**4.2: ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM:-**

In software engineering, an **entity–relationship model** (**ER model**) is a data model for

describing the data or information aspects of a business domain or its process requirements,

in an abstract way that lends itself to ultimately being implemented in a database such as a

relational database. The main components of ER models are entities (things) and the

relationships that can exist among them. However, variants of the idea existed previously,

and have been devised subsequently such as super type and subtype data entities and

commonality relationships.

An entity–relationship model is a systematic way of describing and defining a business

process. The process is modelled as components (*entities*) that are linked with each other by

*relationships* that express the dependencies and requirements between them, such as: *one*

*building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located*

*in one building.* Entities may have various properties (*attributes*) that characterize them.

Diagrams created to represent these entities, attributes, and relationships graphically are

called entity–relationship diagrams.

An ER model is typically implemented as a database. In the case of a relational database,

which stores data in tables, every row of each table represents one instance of an entity. Some

data fields in these tables point to indexes in other tables; such pointers represent the

relationships.

The three schema approach to software engineering uses three levels of ER models that may

be developed.

An entity may be defined as a thing capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely

identified. An entity is an abstraction from the complexities of a domain. When we speak of

an entity, we normally speak of some aspect of the real world that can be distinguished from

other aspects of the real world.

A relationship captures how entities are related to one another. Relationships can be thought

of as verbs, linking two or more nouns.

Cardinality constraints are expressed as follows:

• A double line indicates a *participation constraint*, totality or subjectivity : all entities

in the entity set must participate in *at least one* relationship in the relationship set;

17 | P a g e





• An arrow from entity set to relationship set indicates a key constraint, i.e. injectivity:

each entity of the entity set can participate in *at most one* relationship in the

relationship set;

• A thick line indicates both, i.e. bijectivity: each entity in the entity set is involved in

*exactly one* relationship.

• An underlined name of an attribute indicates that it is a key: two different entities or

relationships with this attribute always have different values for this attribute.

Symbols used in ERD:-

Entities, which are represented by rectangles. An entity is an object or concept about which

you want to store information.

A weak entity is an entity that must defined by a foreign key relationship with another entity

as it cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes alone.

**Actions**, which are represented by diamond shapes,

show how two entities share information in the database.

**Attributes**, which are represented by ovals. A key attribute is

the unique, distinguishing characteristic of the entity. For example, an employee's social

security number might be the employee's key attribute.

18 | P a g e





A multivalued attribute can have more than one value

A derived attribute is based on another attribute. For example, an

employee's monthly salary is based on the employee's annual salary.

**Connecting lines**, solid lines that connect attributes to show the relationships of entities in

the diagram.

**Cardinality** specifies how many instances of an entity relate to one instance of another

entity. Ordinality is also closely linked to cardinality. While cardinality specifies the

occurrences of a relationship, ordinality describes the relationship as either mandatory or

optional. In other words, cardinality specifies the maximum number of relationships and

ordinality specifies the absolute minimum number of relationships.

**4.3: USE CASE DIAGRAM**

A **use case diagram** at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system

that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is

involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the

different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well.

So only static behaviour is not sufficient to model a system rather dynamic behaviour is more

important than static behaviour. In UML there are five diagrams available to model dynamic

nature and use case diagram is one of them. Now as we have to discuss that the use case

diagram is dynamic in nature there should be some internal or external factors for making the

interaction.

These internal and external agents are known as actors. So use case diagrams are consists of

actors, use cases and their relationships. The diagram is used to model the system/subsystem

of an application. A single use case diagram captures a particular functionality of a system.

So to model the entire system numbers of use case diagrams are used. The purpose of use

case diagram is to capture the dynamic aspect of a system. But this definition is too generic to

describe the purpose. Because other four diagrams (activity, sequence, collaboration and

State chart) are also having the same purpose. So we will look into some specific purpose

which will distinguish it from other four diagrams.

Use case diagrams are used to gather the requirements of a system including internal and

external influences. These requirements are mostly design requirements. So when a system is

analysed to gather its functionalities use cases are prepared and actors are identified.

Now when the initial task is complete use case diagrams are modelled to present the outside

view. So in brief, the purposes of use case diagrams can be as follows:

Used to gather requirements of a system.

Used to get an outside view of a system.

Identify external and internal factors influencing the system.

Show the interacting among the requirements are actors.

**4.4: DATABASE DESIGN:-**

A database is an organized mechanism that has capability of storing information through

which a user can retrieve stored information in an effective and efficient manner. The data is

the purpose of any database and must be protected.

The database design is two level processes. In the first step, user requirements are gathered

together and a database is designed which will meet these requirements as clearly as possible.

This step is called information Level design and it is taken independent of any individual

DBMS.

**Firebase:**

Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was

originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform

and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

In the following snapshots we display the way we have used MySQL as the backend RDBMS

for our project and the various entities that have been used along with their table definition

and table data

**5.USER INTERFACE DESIGN &**

**IMPLEMENTATION**

**User interface design (UID)** or **user interface engineering** is the design of user interfaces

for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other

electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing the user experience. The goal of user

interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms

of accomplishing user goals (user-centred design).

Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary

attention to it. Graphic design and typography are utilized to support its usability, influencing

how the user performs certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design;

design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use the functions of the

interface. The design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements (e.g.,

mental model) to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to

changing user needs.

Interface design is involved in a wide range of projects from computer systems, to cars, to

commercial planes; all of these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions

yet also require some unique skills and knowledge. As a result, designers tend to specialize in

certain types of projects and have skills centered on their expertise, whether that be software

design, user research, web design, or industrial design.

**6. Why responsive in mobile??**

We have designed a fully responsive APP with the help of frontend framework and design

libraries. Now a days smartphones are different size and different resolution most widely

used and every user would fancy all web activity to be done through those gadgets. Hence we

have come forward with this idea of a fully responsive app with a responsive menu which

automatically fits the app in any screen size and readjusts its components as and when

required, be it smartphones.

**7. Testing and Maintenance :-**

A software system test plan is a document that describes the objectives, scope, approach

and focus of software testing effort. The process of preparing a test plan is a usual way to think

the efforts needed to validate the acceptability of a software product. The complete document

will help people outside the test group understand the "WHY" and "HOW" product validation.

It should be through enough to be useful but not so through that no one outside the test group

will read it.

**Introduction of Testing**

Testing is the process of running a system with the intention of finding errors. Testing enhances

the integrity of a system by detecting deviations in design and errors in the system. Testing

aims at detecting error-prone areas. This helps in the prevention of errors in a system. Testing

also adds value to the product by conforming to the user requirements.

The main purpose of testing is to detect errors and error-prone areas in a system. Testing must

be thorough and well-planned. A partially tested system is as bad as an untested system. And

the price of an untested and under-tested system is high.

The implementation is the final and important phase. It involves user-training, system

testing in order to ensure successful running of the proposed system. The user tests the system

and changes are made according to their needs. The testing involves the testing of the developed

system using various kinds of data. While testing, errors are noted and correctness is the mode.

55 | P a g e





**7.1: OBJECTIVES OF TESTING**

The objective our test plan is to find and report as many bugs as possible to improve the

integrity of our program. Although exhaustive testing is not possible, we will exercise a broad

range of tests to achieve our goal. Our user interface to utilize these functions is designed to

be user-friendly and provide easy manipulation of the tree. The application will only be used

as a demonstration tool, but we would like to ensure that it could be run from a variety of

platforms with little impact on performance or usability.

**Process Overview**

The following represents the overall flow of the testing process:

\1. Identify the requirements to be tested. All test cases shall be derived using the current

Program Specification.

\2. Identify which particular test(s) will be used to test each module.

\3. Review the test data and test cases to ensure that the unit has been thoroughly verified and

that the test data and test cases are adequate to verify proper operation of the unit.

\4. Identify the expected results for each test.

\5. Document the test case configuration, test data, and expected results.

\6. Perform the test(s).

\7. Document the test data, test cases, and test configuration used during the testing process.

This information shall be submitted via the Unit/System Test Report (STR).

\8. Successful unit testing is required before the unit is eligible for component

integration/system testing.

\9. Unsuccessful testing requires a Bug Report Form to be generated. This document shall

describe the test case, the problem encountered, its possible cause, and the sequence of events

that led to the problem. It shall be used as a basis for later technical analysis.

\10. Test documents and reports shall be submitted. Any specifications to be reviewed,

revised, or updated shall be handled immediately.

**7.2: TEST CASES**

A test case is a document that describe an input, action, or event and expected response, to

determine if a feature of an application is working correctly. A test case should contain

56 | P a g e





particular such as test case identifier, test condition, input data. The process of developing

test cases can help find problems in the requirement or design of an application, since it

requires completely thinking through the operation of the application.

**WHITE BOX TESTING**

In white box testing, the UI is bypassed. Inputs and outputs are tested directly at the code

level and the results are compared against specifications. This form of testing ignores the

function of the program under test and will focus only on its code and the structure of that

code. Test case designers shall generate cases that not only cause each condition to take on all

possible values at least once, but that cause each such condition to be executed at least once.

To ensure this happens, we will be applying Branch Testing. Because the functionality of the

program is relatively simple, this method will be feasible to apply.

Each function of the binary tree repository is executed independently; therefore, a program

flow for each function has been derived from the code.

**BLACK BOX TESTING**

Black box testing typically involves running through every possible input to verify that it

results in the right outputs using the software as an end-user would. We have decided to

perform Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis testing on our application.

System Testing

The goals of system testing are to detect faults that can only be exposed by testing the entire

integrated system or some major part of it. Generally, system testing is mainly concerned

with areas such as performance, security, validation, load/stress, and configuration

sensitivity. But in our case well focus only on function validation and performance. And in

both cases, we will use the black-box method of testing

**8. SYSTEM SECURITY MEASURES**

**DATABASE SECURITY**

System security measure is meant to be provided to make your system reliable and secured

from unauthorized user may create threats to the system. So you should follow some security

measures. We have used security levels in database level at system level

**SYSTEM SECURITY**

If we talk about the system security in our proposed system we have implemented with the

help of maintain the session throughout the system’s use. Once a user has logged out than

he/she will not be able to perform any task before signing back again.

A high level of authentic login is given to the system so this is a very tedious task to enter

without authorization and authentication.

**LIMITATION**

There are some limitations in the App:

\1. The app only supports vertical mode not Horizontal mode.

\2. We can’t fast forward the video.

\3. user must have account to access the app.

\4. Brightness control is not available while playing the video.

**9. FUTURE SCOPE AND FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS**

In future, we would like to keep working on this project and make new additions to provide

users with more advanced features and more detailed information. We have set our sights on

the following additions in future-

\1. Forgot Password

\2. Push notification

\3. Use live classes feature.

\4. Add examination feature.

\5. Live chat

**10. CONCLUSION**

This project has been appreciated by all the users in the organization. It is easy to use, since it

uses the GUI provided in the user dialog. User friendly screens are provided. The usage of

software increases the efficiency, decreases the effort. It has been efficiently employed as a

Site management mechanism. It has been thoroughly tested and implemented.

The project **“Step up code”** is the ideal place for every Student who want to learn from home

in this covid-19 pandemic situation. The software provides a reliable platform for keeping all

sensitive information. For this kind of online business, the special software must be installed

on the server which host the site, or on a secure server which receives all sensitive data.
